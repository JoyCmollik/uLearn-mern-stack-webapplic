# uLearn - A Revolutionary Learning Management System\n\n[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)\n\nuLearn is a new cutting-edge learning management system that aims to equalize access to educational resources for all students. It is a robust system designed specifically to enhance your learning experience while ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to excel. \n\n## Introduction 🎓 \nWhile in our final academic year in the university, we noticed a distinct gap in the way students accessed and shared study materials. Some students who had mastered the art of note-taking and could access various resources did remarkably well while the others who were not as fortunate lagged. This observed inequality instigated the creation of uLearn! \n\nThe platform's goal is to solve this gap by creating a network where students can share resources, form communities, and ensure no one is disadvantaged regarding accessing educational materials. \n\n## Technology Stack 👨‍💻  \n\nuLearn uses a number of open source projects to work properly:\n\n- **Backend** - Node.js and Express.js\n- **Frontend** - React.js\n- **Database** - MongoDB\n- **Real-time Communication** - Socket.io\n- **Others** - Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, axios, jodit-react, swiper, framer-motion, react-hook-form, recharts\n\n## Features 📚 \n\n  - Course Enrollment\n  - Organised Course Content\n  - Dedicated Discussion Panels for each Course\n  - Real-time Commenting and Upvoting\n  - Notification System for receiving Votes and Comments\n  - Creation and Updating of courses by Content Creators\n  - Admin Management\n\nWhat’s more? uLearn also has a feature that allows students to form communities, connect with each other, and foster peer-to-peer learning!\n\n## Visit Us\n[Live Site](https://ulearn.onrender.com/)\n\n## Get Involved 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\nWhether you’re a struggling student in search of study materials, or someone with so much knowledge you’d like to share with others, uLearn is the platform for you.
