# uLearn - A Revolutionary Learning Management System 

uLearn is a new cutting-edge learning management system that aims to equalize access to educational resources for all students. It is a robust system designed specifically to enhance your learning experience while ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to excel.

## Introduction 🎓
In the final year of our university, we noticed a significant gap in the access and sharing of study materials among students. Some students were excelling due to their capability to take organized notes and access various resources, while others were lagging because they lacked these resources. This inequality led us to create uLearn! 

The goal of this platform is to reduce this gap, allowing students to share resources, form communities, and ensure no student is disadvantaged in accessing quality educational materials.

## Technology Stack 👨‍💻  
uLearn uses the following technologies:

- **Backend** - Node.js and Express.js

- **Database** - MongoDB
- **Real-time Communication** - Socket.io
